<h3><a name="WrestlerName">Wrestler Name</a></h3>
<blockquote>The name of the wrestler</blockquote>
<br>
<h3><a name="GeneralCard">General Card</a></h3>
<blockquote>The General Card varies with respect to the wrestler's ability.  
            The General Card is used to determine if a wrestler is on offense
			or defense.  On the General Card, dice totals ranging from 2-12
			are shown with two potential results:
			<ol>
   				<li>OC = Wrestler needs to roll on Offensive Card</li>
   				<li>DC = Wrestler needs to roll on Defensive Card</li>
   			</ol>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3><a name="DefensiveCard">Defensive Card</a></h3>
<blockquote>The Defensive Card lists the possible defensive actions a wrestler can
            take.  Again dice totals ranging from 2-12 are represented with the 
			following possibilities:
			<ul type="square">
   				<li><p>A = Wrestler attempts to break the opponent's offensive move but are unsuccessful</li></p>
   				<li><p>B = Wrestler simply absorbs the damage of the opponent's offensive move</li></p>
			   	<li><p>C = Wrestler effectively neutralizes the opponent's offensive move</li></p>
			   	<li><p>REVERSE = Wrestler counters the opponent's offensive move and immediately
				    becomes the offensive wrestler</li></p>
			</ul>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3><a name="SpecialtyCard">Specialty</a></h3>
<blockquote>The Specialty Card lists the wrestler's most effective move and the possible
            point totals when the specialty move is executed.  In addition to the point
			totals in the list, it's possible that the move could result in a submission
			opportunity (denoted by a "*") or a pin attempt (denoted by P/A).
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3><a name="Submission">SUB</a></h3>
<blockquote>If the wrestler is the victim of a submission hold, the range of numbers
            listed here comes into play.  When a submission roll is made, if the result
			falls into the range of numbers listed, the wrestler submits.
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3><a name="TagTeam">TAG-TEAM</a></h3>
<blockquote>The TAG-TEAM factor is used when, during a tag team match, the wrestler's partner is in 
            a pinning predicament or a submission hold.  If the situation is dire the wrestler
			will attempt to make a save.  If the saving roll falls within the range of 
			numbers listed, the wrestler will make the save.
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3><a name="Priority">PRIORITY</a></h3>
<blockquote>These are the ratings of the wrestler in singles and tag team matches.
            The first number is the rating for singles matches and the second number is 
			the rating for tag matches.  The ratings are broken down as follows:

<h3><a name="OffensiveCard">Offensive Card</a></h3>
<blockquote>The Offensive Card lists the moves employed by the wrestler.  For each
			offensive move there is a point total which indicates the effectiveness
			of the move.  There are also moves without point totals such as ROPES,
			Specialty moves (denoted by a "(S)"), and Disqualification moves (denoted by
			a "(DQ").  ROPES means that the player will need to roll on the ROPES card.  
			A specialty move means that the player will need to roll on the Specialty card.
			A disqualification move, means that the wrestler has thrown the opponent out
			of the ring and could potentially win by countout.
			<p>An offensive move can also be a submission hold (denoted by a "*")
			or a move that leads to a pin attempt (denoted by a "P/A").</p>
			<p>The (XX) is used for Grudge Matches which are currently
			not implemented.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3><a name="Ropes">ROPES</a></h3>
<blockquote>The ROPES section lists various rope manuevers and their corresponding
            point totals.  An "NA" means there was No Action at the ropes, which results
			 in 0 points for the wrestler. Additionally, a move on the ROPES card can be a 
			Specialty move (denoted by a "(S)"), a move that leads to a pin attempt (denoted 
			by a "P/A"), a submission move (denoted by a "*"), or a disqualification move 
			(denoted by a "(DQ)").
