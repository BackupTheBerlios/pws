				<FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=3>While double teaming is occuring
				it's possible for members of the shorthanded team to get injured
				while being double teamed.  During the first round of double
				teaming a calculation is made to check if an injury has occurred.
				 If there is an injury, the injury can last anywhere from 2 to 10
				rounds.  The program will display and keep track of who was
				injured and for how many rounds.  Injured wrestlers will be
				surrounded by a red box on the user interface.  Also the number
				of injury rounds remaining will be displayed next to the injured
				wrestler's name.</FONT></FONT></P>
				<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium">
				<FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=3>When a wrestler is injured, the
				remaining man becomes the man-in for the duration of the injury
				(in a six man match, you will be able to choose which man-out
				becomes the man-in).   If a team has a man injured, the opposing
				team gets an automatic 2 on 1 for one round if they roll OC/TT. 
				If both members of a team are injured, the opposing team rolls
				unopposed on their offensive card for the number of injury rounds
				remaining.</FONT></FONT></P>

				<h1><a name="Ref">Referee Factor</a></h1>
				<p>At the beginning of a match, a referee is assigned. The referees available are:
				<ul>
				    <li><p>“Fast Count” Frank – When attempting a pin there is a +1 to 
					    the pin roll (makes a pin slightly easier to get)</li></p>
					<li><p>“Honest” Abe – There are no bonuses or penalties to the pin roll</li></p>
					<li><p>“Slow-Count” Sam - When attempting a pin there is a -1 to the pin roll 
					    (makes a pin slightly harder to get)</li></p>
				</ul>
				"Honest Abe" should end up refereeing 85% of the matches.  The assigned referee will be 
				displayed in the message window at the beginning of the match.
